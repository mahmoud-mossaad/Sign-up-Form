# Notes   

Bootstrap used in sign up form is BootstrapCDN <br> https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css <br>
(Angular code in index.html):
```javaScript
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-MCw98/SFnGE8fJT3GXwEOngsV7Zt27NXFoaoApmYm81iuXoPkFOJwJ8ERdknLPMO" crossorigin="anonymous">
```
This form is without any routing feature, And everything is written within the Root component.

The data is sent to the server -which is in port 3000- in a JSON format:
```javaScript
{
    fName:"",
    lName:"",
    email:"",
    password:""
}
```
